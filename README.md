Part 1. DICOM Input and Output:
	IO.py is the step one implementation.
	IO2.py is the step two implementation.
	Note that I change the commandline for:
	--output-hdf5, -h --input-hdf5, -h
	to 
	--output-hdf5, -f --input-hdf5, -i
	because of -h conflict with --help

Part 2. Inference Pipeline and 3D Blurring Module
	I didnot finish debugging the Gaussian Blurring function.
	For the pipeline part, I ran out of time for devoting in the mechanism behind Gaussian blurring. 

Part 3. A Web Backend
	I ran out of time to do this part too.
